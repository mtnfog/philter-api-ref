# Philter API Reference Implementation

[Philter](https://www.mtnfog.com/products/philter/) identifies and manipulates sensitive information in text. This project is a reference implementation of Philter's [Filtering API](https://docs.mtnfog.com/philter/api/api-1/api). This project can be used for testing Philter integrations without requiring an instance of Philter.

**This project is currently a work in progress.**
